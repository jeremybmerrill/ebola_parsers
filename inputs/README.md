Each folder contains a template and one or more PDF situation reports (sitreps). 
The data in the sitreps needs to be entered into the template.

The steps are as follows:
* Download the files. Either clone or fork the directory, or go back up to the main page
and click 'Download zip' on the righthand toolbar.
* For each table, enter the data into the corresponding row on the template. The format
of the tables on the PDF is very different from the template format, because the
situation report formats have changed a lot over the last six months. Part of the value
of this repository is that I have kept formatting consistent, so users don't have to manipulate
the data. This is also why this task is rather tedious.
* If there are variables on the situation reports that do not appear on the template,
you can either add a row, or skip it.
* When you are done, either send a pull request or email me the file at cmrivers@vbi.vt.edu.
* If you have any questions, send me an email or tweet at @cmyeaton. I am generally very responsive 
and happy to answer questions.
